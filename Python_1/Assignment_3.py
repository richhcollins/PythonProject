# Get input
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

# Calculate BMI
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# Determine BMI category
if bmi < 18.5:
    category = "Underweight"
elif 18.5 <= bmi < 24.9:
    category = "Normal weight"
elif 25 <= bmi < 29.9:
    category = "Overweight"
else:
    category = "Obese"

# Display results
print(" ")
print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")
print(f"You're categorized as: {category}")
